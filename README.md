This repository simulates a fully decentralized service assembly approach whose main features are: (i) the ability to autonomously and dynamically build and maintain an assembly of available services so that they can fulfill their functional requirements; (ii) the ability to make (as much as possible) the assembly of services energetically autonomous, relying only on locally harvested and stored energy.
