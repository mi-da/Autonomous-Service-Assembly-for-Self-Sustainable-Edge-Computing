The landscape of contemporary computing sys- tems is more and more shifting towards architectures built by composing available services according to the “everything-as-a- service” paradigm and deployed on large distributed cloud-edge infrastructures, with the promise of providing smart services to a variety of possible end users. To be socially and economically acceptable, such systems must anyway meet the increasing concerns about their environmental sustainability. In this context, challenges to be faced include coping with the technical difficulties of operating such systems in inherently open, highly dynamic, and uncertain environments, minimizing at the same time their energetic impact. We tackle these challenges by proposing a fully decentralized service assembly approach whose main features are: (i) the ability to autonomously and dynamically build and maintain an assembly of available services so that they can fulfill their functional requirements; (ii) the ability to make (as much as possible) the assembly of services energetically autonomous, relying only on locally harvested and stored energy. As part of our approach, we propose a general template for the definition of a service selection policy, from which different policies can be easily derived to drive the construction and maintenance of the service assembly. We perform a large set of simulation experiments that provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these policies in meeting the functional and sustainability requirements.
